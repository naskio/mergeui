This is a 120b frankenmerge of [miqu-1-70b](https://huggingface.co/miqudev/miqu-1-70b) created by interleaving layers of [miqu-1-70b-sf](https://huggingface.co/152334H/miqu-1-70b-sf) with itself using [mergekit](https://github.com/cg123/mergekit).

Inspired by [Venus-120b-v1.2](https://huggingface.co/nsfwthrowitaway69/Venus-120b-v1.2), [MegaDolphin-120b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/MegaDolphin-120b), and [goliath-120b](https://huggingface.co/alpindale/goliath-120b).

Thanks for the EXL2 and GGUF quants, [Lone Striker](https://huggingface.co/LoneStriker)!

>
> Miqu-1 does ignore instructions a little. I tried to make a more sarcastic/insulting AI assistant to chat with, and specifically told it (multiple times after a few tries) to not apologize to me after, and it wouldn't stop. So if it made a jab like "Wow, great work spelling that word. Quite the whiz kid huh?", making fun of me for misspelling something, it would refuse to not follow up with "Seriously, though, sometimes misspellings happen" lol. But that's the only issue I've had with it.

(Note: All I did was merge this, though, so the credit mostly belongs to [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) (giving proper attribution!) and the creators of [mergekit](https://github.com/arcee-ai/mergekit) as well as [Venus-120b-v1.2](https://huggingface.co/nsfwthrowitaway69/Venus-120b-v1.2) and [MegaDolphin-120b](https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/MegaDolphin-120b) who inspired it.)

### Support

- [My Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/wolframravenwolf) if you'd like to tip me to say thanks or request specific models to be tested or merged with priority. Also consider supporting your favorite model creators, quantizers, or frontend/backend devs if you can afford to do so. They deserve it!

## Disclaimer

*This model contains leaked weights and due to its content it should not be used by anyone.* üòú

But seriously:

### License

**What I *know*:** [Weights produced by a machine are not copyrightable](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1amc080/psa_if_you_use_miqu_or_a_derivative_please_keep/kpmamte/) so there is no copyright owner who could grant permission or a license to use, or restrict usage, once you have acquired the files.

### Ethics

**What I *believe*:** All generative AI, including LLMs, only exists because it is trained mostly on human data (both public domain and copyright-protected, most likely acquired without express consent) and possibly synthetic data (which is ultimately derived from human data, too). It is only fair if something that is based on everyone's knowledge and data is also freely accessible to the public, the actual creators of the underlying content. Fair use, fair AI!
